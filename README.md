## Problem 2
I choose to critique the visualization of Parth Tandel. Link to the original: 
https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ParthTandel/DS5500-Assignment-1/blob/master/Combined_Questions.ipynb.

To plot the distribution of income across countries and 
continents over time, he has visualized 6 plots. The first
plot is to see the relationship between the income across 
countries over time using a line plot for each country. 
Then he has used 4 plots (one for each continent) get the relationship between
the income across countries over time in a particular 
continent using a line plot for each country. Then he has used
one plot to visualized the aggregated income for each
continent over time.

The plot that we have created are similar as I have created 
all the plot created by him but apart from that have visualized
income across all the countries individually in separate plot
and using color to group countries by continents. Also, I have 
visualized each continent separately too.

His plot is easy to interpret when you want to see the how the
income is changing over time across continents. But it gets 
difficult to interpret how the income is changing across 
countries as it is difficult to distinguish among so many colors. It gets better when the countries are divided by
continents but is still difficult as there are many countries.

It does effectively visualized what is asked but can be a bit
hard to read as it has a lot of information in a static plot.
It would have been better if an interactive plot would have 
been used by both of us.

## Problem 3
 I choose to critique the visualization of Monica Mishra. Link to
 the original visualization is  https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1v8EY74vQxPubjXHywpDUYo7a3FMj-GuB
 
To plot the the relationship between income (GDP / capita), life expectancy, and child
mortality over time within each continent, she has used 3 plots. One plot to visualize the
relationship between income over time for each continent, one to visualize the
relationship between life expectancy over time for each continent and one plot to 
visualize the relationship between income over time for each continent

The major difference between our plot is that I have plotted 4 plots, one for
each continent and visualized the relationship between income (GDP / capita), life expectancy, and child
mortality over time for that continent. Another different is that she has used interactive
plot and I have used a static plot. I feel that here interactive plot is not helping 
much in the visualization and a static plot should suffice as there is not a lot of 
information in the plot. Also interactivity adds computational overhead. 

It is easy to interpret as the plot is well labelled and doesn't have too much 
information in a single plot. 

It effectively visualizes what is being asked, as 
it does show the relationship of income over time across continents, relationship of life expectancy over time across 
continents and relationship of child mortality over time across continents.
But it is fails to capture the relationship between income, life expectancy and 
child mortality over time which each other as they are not in the same plot.
